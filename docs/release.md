# Release Gates

Deslop uses `shipwright.json` as the source of truth for release
artifacts and IDE startup checks.

Source-controlled project versions intentionally stay at the placeholder
`0.0.0-dev`. Release and test workflows stamp the tag version into the working
tree with:

```bash
node scripts/stamp-release-version.mjs 1.2.3
```

The release workflow must never commit that stamped tree back to Deslop. The
tagged commit is the source identity; the stamped working tree is only the
build/package input.

Before publishing, run:

```bash
make deployment-verify
make vsix-package
make jetbrains-package
```

Test entry points remove cargo-installed `deslop`, `deslop-lsp`, and
`deslop-mcp` binaries before running. VSIX tests stage the release binaries
inside `clients/vscode/bin/<platform>/` and clear resolver override
environment variables so activation proves the extension bundle, not PATH.
VSIX release artifacts are platform-specific and must be packaged with
`vsce package --target`; release filenames use
`deslop-vscode-X.Y.Z-<target>.vsix`.

`make jetbrains-package` builds the JetBrains plugin zip, runs Gradle project
configuration and plugin structure verification, then runs
`scripts/verify-jetbrains-package.mjs` against the generated archive. The
archive verifier checks the root `shipwright.json`, the manifest-listed
host `deslop-lsp` binary, executable mode on Unix platforms, `--version`
identity, and undeclared native files under the shipped `bin/<platform>/`
directory. On Unix hosts the Makefile uses `gradle` from `PATH` when available,
then falls back to a cached Gradle 9.0.0 distribution under
`~/.gradle/wrapper/dists`; set `GRADLE=/path/to/gradle` to override it.

The shared Deployment Toolkit repository is private:
`Nimblesite/Shipwright` (formerly `MelbourneDeveloper/deployment_toolkit`).
Agents working from Deployment Toolkit migration issues must use authenticated
`gh` access before relying on its docs or fixtures:

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo view Nimblesite/Shipwright --json nameWithOwner,isPrivate,url,defaultBranchRef
```

When Deslop changes its deployment contract, update the private toolkit fixtures
for `fixtures/manifests/deslop.json` and the Rust version-output fixtures in the
same release workflow.
